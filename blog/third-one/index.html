<p>Are you interested in the details of this position? Thank you. If you are not free who can you recommend? I am very interested in your profile and was hoping to speak to you about a number of contract opportunities that i have available in Amsterdam at the moment. If not, I would be glad to keep in touch with you for any future interesting vacancies. Hopefully I can differentiate myself from the rest and hopefully you can see why I made the effort to contact you.</p>
<p>I would like to speak with you. I came across you profile and I really liked it. I was wondering if you could be looking at new opportunities? I have a contract near Amsterdam starting end of June for 500 euros a day. While I appreciate that another recruitment contact/connection may be the last thing you need, I can assure you that I genuinely work on sourcing engineers for some of the largest, most distributed and technically challenging systems and applications in London and the South East.</p>
<p>I came across your profile while on the lookout for strong software engineers and was very impressed with your experience and background. I work with some of the top Tech Start-ups and Software Houses in London and the South East and am looking to build up my network of strong developers so I’d be keen to connect so we can keep in touch for the future. This is the ultimate opportunity for frontend developers in Rotterdam to become a real expert in their field.</p>
<p>Please see role details below. I really don’t care if you are currently looking for a job or not, but I would love to have a chat with you. Looking forward to hearing from you. The reason I decided to get in touch is because I am working very closely with some of the most exciting technology-centric companies in London with finding the best talent for their organisations.</p>

      <description>Are you interested in the details of this position? Thank you. If you are not free who can you recommend? I am very interested in your profile and was hoping to speak to you about a number of contract opportunities that i have available in Amsterdam at the moment. If not, I would be glad to keep in touch with you for any future interesting vacancies. Hopefully I can differentiate myself from the rest and hopefully you can see why I made the effort to contact you.</description>

    <p>Here is your Recruitment Ipsum!
Recruitment ipsum first of all I want to apologise for contacting you randomly out of the blue. You&rsquo;ll be rewarded with; competitive salary and benefits, room to grow and develop yourself including training, a stunning central London location, a great environment with intelligent, driven and passionate colleagues delivering excellence on a daily basis, and will always work with cutting edge technologies.</p>
<p>Are you currently open to hearing about something new? We are growing our team and we are currently looking for a Senior UI Solutions Developer based in the Netherlands. Would you be able to send me a copy of your CV and contact number so we can talk about this contract position based in the Hague, Netherlands. As I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve intimated earlier, I appreciate you are likely to get these kind of emails all the time but with the above in mind I&rsquo;d love to connect either way and then keep in touch from there.</p>
<p>Please let us know in case you have any such requirement, so that we can discuss rates Would you consider having an initial, informal and brief conversation about this opportunity? Does this sound of interest to you, if so when are you free today to speak? The reason I ask is because I am currently working on a senior/lead frontend role for a product company based in Utrecht. I thought (on the face of it anyway) it looked like a good match for your profile.</p>
<p>I would like to get in touch with you regarding a new opportunity RED have in North Belgium for an Angular developer. If you are interested, lets organise a good time to talk on the phone - I can arrange for whenever is convenient for you! I noticed you were open to new opportunities and I wanted to make you aware of an opportunity that I am working on which may be of interest to you. We want to fill this positions soon.</p>
<p>They are offering you the chance to work with clients of all sizes, from global enterprises to local start-ups meaning you will get all the benefits of working for a huge organisation with over 100,00 employees and the autonomy you get from some of their smaller clients. I&rsquo;m sure you get a few messages so I will happily be upfront with you and send over the jobs and company names I&rsquo;m working with if you had any interest in seeing what was out there?</p>
<p>Its paying £55,000 - £70,000 + 15% Bonus and lots of other benefits. But of course I’m just a recruiter right? Let me know if you are looking for permanent roles at the moment and I’ll be more than happy to give you the details. Last week I read an interesting article &lsquo;9 ways to be less annoying on LinkedIn As software engineer you will work on the front end using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to improve the enterprise software/platforms by adding new functionalities, maintaining API, developing UI components and building frameworks.</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you. First of all I want to apologise for contacting you randomly out of the blue. You get a permanent contract, salary, bonus and a car. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time to have a chat? When can we talk? I look forward to hearing from you. It&rsquo;s a company that does Consutancy-type of work, however because they are a young company with 15 people they really have the time to care about YOUR personal career &amp; development.</p>
<p>I hope you are well. You are my 1st connection, however I do not know anything about you as a person and how you picture your career path? If you are interested, I have a nice opportunity. If you are eager to be challenged developing secure platforms for a huge user spectrum, you need to read further. Our client is looking for an Angular developer to join their deployment team in a large project they are undertaking.</p>
<p>After that we can discuss the details with you. Is this of interest? If so, what is best number to reach you on? If not, would you know anybody that would be interested in this? The program is expected to last 10 years. Our team want to meet a Front-End developer who is passionate about gaming technologies, knows his job as a professional and involved in games as crazy. Are you looking for a reliable, creative and experience Group for the Mobile Application and Website Designing and development?</p>
<p>Now this will sound a little generic, because every man and his dog will tell you there looking for a guy with a set of skills like yours? I checked out your profile and noticed you have strong experience in a range of technologies. They are known globally as a major technology player – pioneering the digital advances that are shaping and driving the information age. I came across your LinkedIn profile with genuine interest and would be very keen to make contact with you to find out about your current work situation and possible career goals &amp; aspirations.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to hear that actually opportunities like this don’t come around very often; in fact they aren’t even available for very long at all. For this reason I wondered if you would be interested in hearing about a variety new challenges? If you don&rsquo;t currently have experience with these, you will have the option to learn if you wish! I have specifically chosen to write to you, because you have mentioned angularJS on your profile and you currently work at a well-known Consultancy.</p>
<p>Are you interested in the details of this position? Thank you. If you are not free who can you recommend? I am very interested in your profile and was hoping to speak to you about a number of contract opportunities that i have available in Amsterdam at the moment. If not, I would be glad to keep in touch with you for any future interesting vacancies. Hopefully I can differentiate myself from the rest and hopefully you can see why I made the effort to contact you.</p>
<p>I would like to speak with you. I came across you profile and I really liked it. I was wondering if you could be looking at new opportunities? I have a contract near Amsterdam starting end of June for 500 euros a day. While I appreciate that another recruitment contact/connection may be the last thing you need, I can assure you that I genuinely work on sourcing engineers for some of the largest, most distributed and technically challenging systems and applications in London and the South East.</p>
<p>I came across your profile while on the lookout for strong software engineers and was very impressed with your experience and background. I work with some of the top Tech Start-ups and Software Houses in London and the South East and am looking to build up my network of strong developers so I&rsquo;d be keen to connect so we can keep in touch for the future. This is the ultimate opportunity for frontend developers in Rotterdam to become a real expert in their field.</p>
<p>Please see role details below. I really don’t care if you are currently looking for a job or not, but I would love to have a chat with you. Looking forward to hearing from you. The reason I decided to get in touch is because I am working very closely with some of the most exciting technology-centric companies in London with finding the best talent for their organisations.</p>
